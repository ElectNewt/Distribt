Products are a critical part of the system. We  must ensure that when a Product is created or updated the event will get propagated.


There are a few steps to achieve this:

1. Create a table to store the outbox messages
2. the insertion on the outbox table must happen in a transaction within the creation/modification of the Product
3. We need a background processor that will read that table and publish the message, once the message is published, the record must be updated, marking it as sent
4. Don't forget to Add all the necessary unit tests.

Feel free to modfiy any part of the system, but ensure that you are not causing breaking changes. 

The event it is being generated in these two places:
- Create: /src/Services/Products/Distribt.Services.Products.BusinessLogic/UseCases/CreateProductDetails.cs#L40
- Update: /src/Services/Products/Distribt.Services.Products.BusinessLogic/UseCases/UpdateProductDetails.cs#L27
